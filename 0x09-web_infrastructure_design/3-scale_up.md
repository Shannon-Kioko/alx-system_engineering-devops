### Description:
This web infrastructure represents a scaled-up version of the previously described setup. In this enhanced iteration, all Single Points of Failure (SPOFs) have been meticulously removed. Each of the major components, including the web server, application server, and database servers, has been relocated to dedicated GNU/Linux servers. This design ensures the utmost reliability, redundancy, and security.

#### Specifics About This Infrastructure:
The addition of a firewall between each server: In this advanced configuration, a firewall has been deployed between every server. This security measure individually protects each server from unwanted and unauthorized access, significantly enhancing the security posture of the infrastructure. Each server now operates within its own secure perimeter, reducing the risk of security breaches and ensuring a high level of protection.

#### Issues With This Infrastructure:
1. High maintenance costs: The move to a more robust infrastructure comes with increased maintenance costs. Distributing major components across separate GNU/Linux servers necessitates the acquisition of more physical servers, resulting in higher upfront hardware expenses. Additionally, the operation of additional servers leads to elevated electricity consumption and operational costs. This includes both the new servers and the existing ones, imposing additional financial burdens on the company. Allocating funds for server procurement and managing increased power consumption becomes a substantial financial consideration.
2. This scaled-up infrastructure represents a balance between heightened security and reliability, and the associated costs that must be weighed carefully when planning and implementing the expansion.
